		Flake8 doesn't need access to the dependencies of the code it lints, as Anthony Sottile, its maintainer, explained[1] in 2019:

		> flake8 by itself (with the default plugin set) is a purely static linter and does not rely on your installed application dependencies

		On the other hand:

		> It is very important to install Flake8 on the correct version of Python for your needs.
		> If you want Flake8 to properly parse new language features in Python 3.5 (for example), you need it to be installed on 3.5 for Flake8 to understand those features.
		> In many ways, Flake8 is tied to the version of Python on which it runs.

		In most cases, the system package of Flake8 is better, because it is kept up to date;
		the Flake8 in a project's virtualenv might be pinned to a specific version or simply outdated.
		This ensures forward compatibility in that the Python in a project run under an older version of the language will be reported if it conflicts with any language feature introduced in later versions.

		The setting `python.linting.flake8Path` defaults to `flake8`.
		With a relative path, as is the default, Code OSS looks for Flake8 in the virtualenv of the corresponding project.
		To overcome this and let Code OSS use the system package, an absolute path must be specified.
