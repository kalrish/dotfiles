	# Without limits like the maximum path length, the maximum recursion depth and the maximum number of symbolic links followed in path resolution, there would be infinite different paths pointing to each file system object.
	# Even with those limits, there are many different paths pointing to each file system object.
	# For example, the path `foo/bar` points to the same file system object as `foo/./bar`, `foo/../foo/bar` and `foo/../foo/./bar`;
	# symbolic and hard links may result in even more different paths pointing to the same file system object.
